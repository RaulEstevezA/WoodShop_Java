# WoodShop_Java

**WoodShop_Java** is a store management system specialized in selling wood products and varnishes, developed using Java 23.0.2 following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

This project manages products, stores, registered and anonymous customers, and records sales through detailed tickets, automatically calculating discounts for professional customers.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java 23.0.2
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
- **System:** Console-based application with menu navigation

---

## Main Features

### Product Management
- Supports three product types:
  - **Tablero** (Board)
  - **Barniz** (Varnish)
  - **Articulo** (Furniture Item)
- Products have specific attributes and are linked to suppliers.
- Managed using an intermediate class **ProductosEnTiendas** to control:
  - **Price** per store
  - **Stock** per store

### Store Management
- Each store maintains its own inventory and ticket list.
- Products can be dynamically added to a store.
- Tickets are linked specifically to the store they are created in.

### Customer Management
- Three customer types:
  - **Anonymous Customer**: No data stored.
  - **Professional Customer**: Stores **name**, **DNI**, and **custom discount**.
  - **WoodFriend Customer**: Stores **name**, **DNI**, and **generated member ID** ("WFxxx").
- Discounts are automatically applied for professional customers at checkout.

### Ticket System
- Each ticket includes:
  - **Auto-generated sequential ID** (no user input needed)
  - **Formatted date** (dd/MM/yyyy)
  - Customer information
  - Detailed product lines with quantities
  - Applied discounts and total calculations
- Ability to **filter tickets** between specific date ranges.
- Tickets are stored inside their respective store.

### Utilities
- **Verificadores Class**: User input validation for text, numbers, enums, dates, etc.
- **CargarDatos Class**: Preloads sample data including products, stores, customers, and tickets.
- **Javadoc**: Full documentation generated for all classes.

### New in AA5
- **Sales Summary by Store Between Two Dates**  
  New functionality allows you to generate a report that summarizes the total revenue per store based on a date range.
- **New Method: `calcularTotal()`**  
  Each ticket can now calculate its total value directly, including applied discounts.
- **New Method in `Tiendas`: `calcularVentasEntreFechas()`**  
  Computes and prints the total of all tickets in a store within a specific date range.
- **Input Validation Enhancement**  
  A new utility method `Verificadores.pedirDosFechas()` ensures that the end date is never earlier than the start date.
- **Menu Option 10 Added**  
  The new summary report is accessible from the console through a dedicated menu option.
